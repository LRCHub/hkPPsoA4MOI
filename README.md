[00:00.00] We had been flying all day long at 100 fucking feet
[00:04.46] The weather fucking awful fucking rain and fucking sleet
[00:08.39] The compass it was swinging South East West and fucking North
[00:12.07] And we made a fucking landfall in the Firth of fucking Forth
[00:42.07] 
[00:15.99] Ain't the Air Force fucking awful
[00:19.74] Ain't the Air Force fucking awful
[00:23.50] Ain't the Air Force fucking awful
[00:27.11] And we made a fucking landfall in the Firth of fucking Forth
[00:57.11] 
[00:31.19] We flew the North Atlantic till it made us fucking weep
[00:35.01] The sea was fucking wet and fucking cold and fucking deep
[00:38.73] Operations Room of 30 Wing is simply fucking rotten
[00:42.30] And 269 will be there till they're fucking well forgotten
[01:10.80] 
[00:46.43] Ain't the Air Force fucking awful
[00:50.45] Ain't the Air Force fucking awful
[00:54.20] Ain't the Air Force fucking awful
[00:57.82] And 269 will be there till they're fucking well forgotten
[01:26.32] 
[01:04.62] "I say Charlie, Charlie ain't the Air Force fucking awful Over"
[01:11.25] "Sorry skip, we're not picking you up there, I- bad signal Over"
[01:17.42] "Charlie, Charlie ain't the Air Force fucking awful Over"
[01:24.86] "Sorry skip signal's breaking up we're not picking you up at all Over"
[01:29.40] "Tell you what though, ain't the Air Force fucking awful"
[01:57.90] 
[01:32.59] We joined the fucking Air Force 'cause we thought it fucking right
[01:36.05] But we don't give a bugger if we fly or fucking fight
[01:39.78] But what we do object to are those fucking Ops Room twots
[01:43.39] Who sit there sewing stripes on at a rate of fucking knots
[02:12.39] 
[01:47.55] Ain't the Air Force fucking awful
[01:51.14] Ain't the Air Force fucking awful
[01:55.04] Ain't the Air Force fucking awful
[01:58.34] And they sit there sewing stripes on at a rate of fucking knots
